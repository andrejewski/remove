# Re:Move

D-pad controls are simple. You hit Up, it takes you up. You hit Left, it takes you left. Introducing a new generation of D-pads. Each one features a deterministic (no randomness) algorithm to decide how you move next based on your present and past moves. Move with urgency and focus through all {N} levels with only your determination, wit, Up, Down, Left, and Right.
